            <h1><span>About me</span></h1>    
            <p>It's pretty safe to say that <span class="accent-white">lockdown 2020</span> was rough for everyone but for anyone fresh out of high school, with no idea what they wanted to do, <em>"<span class="accent-white">the pressure was getting</span> <span class="accent-emphasis">worser</span>"</em>. I, at that point, had no interest in computers or anything related to <span class="accent-white">tech</span> but since I had nothing better to do, I gave it a shot.</p>

            <p>To my massive surprise, I turned out to be pretty decent. I landed a few <span class="accent-white">freelancing jobs in web development </span>along the way then ended up with the pleasure of working at a <a href="https://beckandstone.com/"><span class="accent-emphasis">brand consultancy</span></a>  based in the <span class="accent-white"> United States</span>.</p>
            <p>I've come a long way since my origin story, and I've come to really enjoy building <span class="accent-white">interactive websites </span>  with an emphasis on animations and bringing every page to life. I always experiment and do more research to find the best ways to give sites an almost <span class="accent-emphasis">"video-game-like"</span> feel to them as much as I can.</p>
            <p>When I'm not slamming my head against the desk by my computer trying to rid myself of every error that appears in the web console, I quite enjoy an <em><span class="accent-white">extremely</span></em> cheeky game of soccer and other sports as well as making the most of my time spent with close friends. I am also currently studying <span class="accent-white"> software engineering</span> at <a href="https://www.hyperiondev.com/" target=_blank><span class="accent-emphasis">Hyperion</span></a>.</p>
